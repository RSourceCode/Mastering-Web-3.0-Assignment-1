## Design Approach:
I started with loading the json files. next I iterated over them and in a batch of 32 or less, started adding them to my blocks

## Implementation Details:

## Results and Performance: 
I was able to get my block header in the required format

Also able to print the txid's in the way it was asked to

## Conclusion: 
It was a great experience in developing this simplistic blockchain. Did face a lot of issue but overcame them with time.

If I would understand what to do with the info in these json files, those things could be implemented in it.
